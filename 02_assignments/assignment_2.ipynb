        "\n",
        "**Objective**: In this assignment, your task is to utilize Python programming skills to evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background**: Imagine a clinical trial where 60 patients were administered a new drug for arthritis. Data from this trial has been recorded in a series of CSV files. Evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Structure**:\n",
        "- Each CSV file corresponds to a specific check-in session with the patients.\n",
        "- There are 12 such CSV files, reflecting 12 different sessions where patients reported their experiences.\n",
        "- Inside each file:\n",
        "  - Rows: Each of the 60 rows represents a unique patient.\n",
        "  - Columns: Each of the 40 columns corresponds to a day, detailing the number of inflammation flare-ups the patient experienced on that day.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Role**: Analyze this data to determine how effective the new drug has been in managing arthritis inflammation across the trial period."
