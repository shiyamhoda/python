    "# What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming, also known as OOP, is a programming paradigm that encapsulates real life entities around the concept of objects. It is widely used in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we use a real life entity such as a car, how would we capture a single car?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car_name = \"Taylor\"\n",
    "car_brand = \"Honda\"\n",
    "car_model = \"Civic\"\n",
    "car_vin = \"1VWAT7A32EC093779\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how can we capture this if we have two cars? Thousands? Or even millions? If we do it the same way above, it is highly inefficient. This is where OOP comes in handy! We can take a generic entity such as a car, and turn it into a blueprint known as a class. This \"blueprint\" will let us create as many cars as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, brand, model, vin):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.brand = brand\n",
    "    self.model = model\n",
    "    self.vin = vin\n",
    "```\n",

    "Currently, the attributes in our `car` object can be accessed publicly and directly. This is considered bad practice, because the purpose of OOP is to encapsulate everything into an object, and its direct attributes can only be accessed internally. If that's the case, how we can publicly access it? In many OOP languages, we use `getters` to access a private attribute from a class. While we use `setters` to set an attribute value for a class. This is known as data encapsulation.\n",
